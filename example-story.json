  "title": "The Little Match Girl's Last Night",
  "synopsis": "On a cold, snowy night in the old city, a little girl attempts to sell matches door-to-door, but every passerby ignores her. Seeking refuge in a corner, she lights a series of matches to seek warmth and visions. Each flame conjures a beautiful illusion: a roaring stove, a lavish feast with roast goose, and finally, a magnificent Christmas tree and fireworks. In the final moments, she sees her beloved grandmother smiling in the matchlight. Lighting the entire bundle, the girl is embraced by golden light before being discovered peacefully smiling at dawn, surrounded only by burned matchsticks.",
